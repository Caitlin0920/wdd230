                <h2>Taipei 101</h2>
                <p>The capital of Taiwan is a marvelous place to visit, with a plethora of things for visitors to see and do.
                    It is not only the political and economic hub of the island, but also the cultural one, as there is a lively arts and culture scene.
                    <br><br>
                    With an intoxicating mix of old and new to be found in the delicious food and stunning architecture, it is a captivating city to visit.
                    Old temples are located amidst the skyscrapers, and the towering Taipei 101 actually used to be the tallest building in the world.

                <p>The second oldest town on the island is a mesmerising place to visit, and it is particularly renowned for its delicious local cuisine and stunning architecture.
                    <br><br>
                    Located in the northwest of the country, it was once an important seaport and trading center, although its standing has long since declined.
                    Thankfully that has meant that its historic buildings remain intact and there are remarkably over two hundred temples for tourists to visit, with Longshan and Matzu being among the most popular.

                <h2>Alishan National Scenic Area</h2>
                <p>A wild and wonderful place, the Alishan National Scenic Area is very mountainous and actually contains twenty-five mountains that tower to a height of two thousand meters or more.
                    Exploring the hills, valleys, waterfalls and forests is a magical affair, and the scenery is stupendous to behold.
                    <br><br>

                    A great way to see a lot of the reserve in one go is to take the Alishan Forest Railway, which snakes its way through forests and along mountainsides before stopping off at Fenqihu, a picturesque village with the ruins of a Shinto temple.

                <h2>Taroko National Park</h2>
                <p>Full of beautiful nature and incredible landscapes, this national park takes its name from that of the impressive gorge that runs through it, and as such it is well worth checking out when in Taiwan.
                    Carved out over centuries and millennia by the winding Liwu River, it is Taroko Gorge that is the undoubted highlight of the area, along with the steep valleys, mountains and more features throughout the park.
                    <br><br>
                    With a number of great outdoor activities that visitors can enjoy, you can be river rafting one minute, hiking through the canyons the next and be bathing in the Baiyang Waterfalls later that same day.
